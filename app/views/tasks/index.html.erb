<!-- Should display a list of all tasks and, for each task:
a link to its show view (use a link_to helper)
a link to its edit view
a link to its delete action. Hint: a standard link does not allow to perform DELETE request, so here you should add a method: :delete option to your link_to helper.
Should include a link to the new view to create a new task
